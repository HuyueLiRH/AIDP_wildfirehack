## Data (extending the LLM)

### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) aims to improve prediction quality by using an external datastore at inference time to build a richer prompt that includes some combination of context, history, and recent/relevant knowledge

- [What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/)

### Amazon Bedrock Series

- Video:Â [Implementing RAG with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Titan - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIw_Ivvrp8g)

From the creator: "In this tutorial, we will build a chatbot based on the Retrieval Augmented Context generation technique. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is used as the vector database, Amazon Titan is used for generating text embeddings and as an LLM, and Amazon Bedrock API is used for invoking the Titan model."

### ICBC Chatbot

A chatbot that uses the ICBC website information as its knowledge base to answer questions that are asked by the users who want to learn more about driving licenses, insurance, and anything ICBC-related. This website can be hosted on an EC2 instance. This chatbot can be based on theÂ [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), which provides a light-weight python-based web framework.
